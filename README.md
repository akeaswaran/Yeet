# Yeet
A simple one-tap messaging app based on modern teenage slang and Yo.

### Features/Notes
* Simple one-tap messaging, like [Yo](http://www.justyo.co).
* Built on safe and secure [Parse.com](http://parse.com) cloud platform and Apple's own [CloudKit](https://developer.apple.com/icloud/documentation/cloudkit-storage/).
* Really barebones; not intended for release, just for practice.

### Credits
* CloudKit functions adapted from [JagCesar's CloudKit version of Yo.](https://github.com/JagCesar/CloudKit-YO).
